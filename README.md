# Chat-app
Mobile application made in Android Studio using Java language. In this app I implemented creation of an account, password retrieval, logging in, adding and editting different types of information to the profile (school,occupation), possibility of adding friends, cloud messaging, adding photos and profile picture, Google mapa (adding and clustering markers, adding information to those markers and saving them in Firebase database), possibility of joining events (placed on the map as markers), main page where all nesrby events are posted (with filters), displaying nearby users.
