Mobile application made in Android Studio using Java language. The aim of the app was to allow people from the same neighborhood to attend some activities together. By placing a marker on the map you could add some information about what type of activity you want to do, when and where for example you could place marker on the map with a title running (the icon of the marker would be automatically changed to a running person) and add information where you want to run, for how long and maybe who are you looking for to join you. On the home page of the app there would be nearby activities posted by other users. You could filter out what kind of sports/activities you are interested in and from what range of distance. You can also invite friends and chat with them. There is also a possibilty of searching nearby users if you are looking for people to join your game right now and give them direct invitation to join you. There is also a profile page where you can update information about you (like school, occupation) and set your profile picture or add additional photos.

In this app I implemented creation of an account, password retrieval, logging in, adding and editting different types of information to the profile (school, occupation), possibility of adding friends, cloud messaging, adding photos and profile picture, Google maps (adding and clustering markers, adding information to those markers and saving them in Firebase database), possibility of joining events (placed on the map as markers), main page where all nearby events are posted (with filters), displaying nearby users and inviting them to join.
